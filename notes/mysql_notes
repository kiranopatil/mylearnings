## Notes about SQL
It omits newlines, multiple white spaces, tab spaces are ignored while executing SQL statements... 

## Select a DB
USE DB_name; 

## Execute Multiple sql statements ? then use semicolon
USE DB_name; 
SELECT * FROM TABLE_name;
OR
SELECT * FROM DB_name.TABLE_name;
SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers; 

## Order of Clauses (top-down), you cannot the change the order of clauses
FROM
WHERE
ORDER BY 
HAVING - to be used as a WHERE for GROUP BY.
LIMIT 
    Also it's i better to keep each of the Clauses in a newline while writing SQL statements
    
## DISTINCT - Use it when you want to remove duplicates from columns
## SELECT Clause - COLUMN_Name, COLUMN_Name2
## FROM Clause - TABLE_Name
## WHERE Clause - CONDITION on COLUMN or to FILTER data 
## ORDER BY Clause - Sorting results on COLUMN
## LIMIT Clause - limit no. of records

## USE "AS" for an alias for a column that doesn't exist or the one that exist. 

## ARITHMETIC Operators [Comes under SELECT, WHERE clause to manipulate or filter data]
* / + - [In order]

## Operator precedence can be used using ()

## COMPARISION Operators [Comes under WHERE clause with coniditions to filter data]
> >= < <= = != 
Alternate for != is <> 

## LOGICAL Operators [Comes under WHERE clause with multiple coniditions to filter data]
AND OR NOT [In order]

IN (List of values/date)
BETWEEN (range of Values/date)
LIKE (Specific Pattern in Columes) ; I'ts almost obsolete and REGEXP is replacement for it 
    % indicates any no.of characters
    _ indicates a single character 
    
REGEXP - Pattern Matching
    ^ Starting character 
    $ Ending character 
    | Multiple pattern logical OR 
    [] pattern matching either of the characters listed in []
        '[gh]e' matches ge or he 
        '[a-f]e' its a range and matches ae, be, ce, de, fe.
        
IS NULL - Empty Field and 
IS NOT NULL - Reverse of above 
ORDER BY - Sorting
LIMIT - limit no.of records from our query
DESC -Descending Order
