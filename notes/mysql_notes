## Notes about SQL
It omits newlines, multiple white spaces, tab spaces are ignored while executing SQL statements... 

## Select a DB
USE DB_name; 

## Execute Multiple sql statements ? then use semicolon
USE DB_name; 
SELECT * FROM TABLE_name;
OR
SELECT * FROM DB_name.TABLE_name;
SELECT * FROM sql_store.customers; 

## Order of Clauses (top-down), you cannot the change the order of clauses
FROM
WHERE
ORDER BY 
    Also it's i better to keep each of the Clauses in a newline while writing SQL statements
